# fast_reinforcement_learning_implementation_RL_project

This is an implementation of the algorithms presented in the paper "Fast reinforcement learning with generalized
policy updates" by Andre Barreto, Shaobo Houa, Diana Borsaa, David Silvera, and Doina Precup:
https://www.pnas.org/doi/abs/10.1073/pnas.1907370117

This implementation is based on the implementation made by Marcus Chiam, where you can find his GitHub repository here:
https://github.com/chiamp/fast-reinforcement-learning?tab=readme-ov-file#traditional-reinforcement-learning-framework

You just have to run the "main.ipynb" file to see the results. 
And contrary to the original implementation, the number of episode chosen for the self-play and training process of the different tasks are smaller and shorter than in the original implementation because of the computation time. The results are very different compared to the results of the original implementation.
